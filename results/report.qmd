## Abstract

With the knowledge we have on hand now regarding proteins and their relationship with autism, we sought out to explore the sensitivity of the results and how different methodologies affected them.

## Dataset

Write a brief data description, including: how data were obtained; sample characteristics; variables measured; and data preprocessing. This can be largely based on the source paper and should not exceed 1-2 paragraphs.

## Summary of published analysis

Summarize the methodology of the paper in 1-3 paragraphs. You need not explain the methods in depth as we did in class; just indicate what methods were used and how they were combined. If possible, include a diagram that depicts the methodological design. (Quarto has support for [GraphViz and Mermaid flowcharts](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/diagrams.html).) Provide key results: the proteins selected for the classifier and the estimated accuracy.

## Findings

Summarize your findings here. I've included some subheaders in a way that seems natural to me; you can structure this section however you like.

### Impact of preprocessing and outliers

**Task 1:** The main reason for log-transforming the protein levels in biomarker-raw.csv is to ensure that the model is linear. It helps to reduce the skew of the data which in turn helps handle outliers. This allows for the analysis to be simpler.

**Task 2:** The mean outlier count among all 154 subjects was roughly 15.45. There were some outlier subjects that had an exceedingly high number of outliers, in particular 7 subjects with over 50. Of these outlier subjects, 5 of them were from the TD group while 2 of them were from the ASD group. The mean outlier count for the entire ASD group was 13.25, compared to 17.59 in the TD group. Therefore, it appears that subjects in the TD group tend to have more frequent outliers. Considering there are over 1300 proteins in the dataset, this difference does not seem significant. This difference can be explained by the greater presence of outlier subjects in the TD group, which skews the value of the mean upward. If we look at the median, which is less impacted by outliers, both groups have the exact same median count of 8.5.

We were also curious to examine whether ADOS score had any correlation with the outlier count of ASD subjects. Visually, there does not appear to be any relationship between these 2 variables. Since outlier count by subject is not dependent on group or ADOS score, we conclude that the presence of outliers is completely random.

### Methodlogical variations

**Task 3:**

First,

Then, we also explored using a fuzzy intersection instead of a hard intersection to combine the sets of top predictive proteins across selection methods. After experimenting, we found that using protein that are in the union of the top 3 predictors from each method and the hard intersection(4 proteins in total in which 1 differ from the hard intersection) gives a final model with worse metrics. We tried a fuzzier intersection with the top 5 predictors from each method and the hard intersection but that also hurts the metrics.

### Improved classifier

**Task 4:**
