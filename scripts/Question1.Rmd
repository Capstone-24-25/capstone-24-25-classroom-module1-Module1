1.  What do you imagine is the reason for log-transforming the protein levels in `biomarker-raw.csv`? (Hint: look at the distribution of raw values for a sample of proteins.)

    The reason for log-transforming the protein levels in `biomarker-raw.csv` is likely to reduce skewness

```{r}
biomarker_not_transformed <- read_csv('../data/biomarker-raw.csv', 
         skip = 2,
         col_select = -2L,
         col_names = c('group', 
                       'empty',
                       pull(var_names, abbreviation),
                       'ados'),
         na = c('-', '')) %>%
  filter(!is.na(group)) %>%
  # reorder columns
  select(group, ados, everything())
```
